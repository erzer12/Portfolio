# **App Name**: Nothing Portfolio

## Core Features:

- Header Section: Displays the user's name, job title, logo, and navigation links (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact). Includes a 'Resume' download button. It's sticky to the top of the page with a blurred background effect.
- About Section: Presents a brief professional biography and highlights key skills and experiences.
- Projects Section: Showcases a selection of the user's projects with descriptions and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
- Contact Section: Provides a contact form or direct links to email and social media profiles.
- Footer: Displays copyright information and possibly additional links.
- Home Section: Includes a landing page with name, tagline, brief bio, and a 'View My Work' call-to-action button.
- Custom Cursor: Implement a custom cursor for the entire website to enhance the visual experience (e.g., a simple dot or circle).
- Glitch Hover Effects: Add subtle micro-interactions with a glitch theme: links and buttons should have a unique glitch or flicker hover effect.
- Scroll-triggered Animations: As the user scrolls down the page, make each section fade and slide into view with a slight digital distortion effect

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark navy blue (#0a192f) to mimic the 'Nothing' phone's aesthetic.
- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for general text and elements to ensure readability against the dark background.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for highlights, links, and interactive elements to create a visually interesting contrast.
- Heading font: 'VT323' (monospace sans-serif) for titles and headings, providing a dot-matrix style look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace sans-serif) for body text, offering a clean and readable appearance.
- Subtle text 'glitch' animation for the headings in the home section.
